      "content": "This JavaScript file is designed to manipulate and analyze JavaScript code files, specifically focusing on class declarations and function definitions within those files. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:\n\n1. `prependClassStructure(targetFile, onlyStubs = false)`: This function reads the content of a given target file using `readFile`, retrieves an object containing method names and arguments for each class with their respective methods using `getMethodsWithArguments`, then prepares a new string containing all the classes along with their methods (including optional function names if `includeFunctions` is set to true). Finally, it writes this new content back to the target file.\n\n2. `getMethodsWithArguments(code, onlyStubs = false)`: This helper function parses the given code using Esprima-next and extracts information about classes and their methods along with method arguments. It returns an object where each key is a class name, and its value is an array of objects containing method names, arguments, and whether the method is a stub (empty or contains only return statements without an argument).\n\n3. `getStubMethods(code)`: This function calls `getMethodsWithArguments` with `onlyStubs = true`, then filters out only those methods that are considered stub methods, returning them in a structured format similar to what `getMethodsWithArguments` returns.\n\n4. `getListOfFunctions(code)`: This helper function parses the given code using Esprima-next and extracts information about all functions found within the code (both declared functions and those inside exports). It returns an object where each key is a function name, and its value is an object containing the function's arguments, whether it is a stub, and its line number.\n\nOverall, this file provides utilities to analyze JavaScript code files for class declarations and methods while being able to distinguish between regular functions and stubs (empty or minimal implementations). It can also filter out only stub methods from all method definitions within a given piece of code.",

  "title": "This tool is particularly useful for tasks such as automated refactoring, code generation, static analysis tools, or testing frameworks that require understanding the structure and behavior of JavaScript classes and functions. The ability to identify stubs helps in verifying implementation completeness, automating documentation, or generating tests where necessary.",
