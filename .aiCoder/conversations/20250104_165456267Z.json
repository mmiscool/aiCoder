      "content": "This JavaScript file provides functionality for manipulating JavaScript code files, specifically focusing on class structures and methods.  Let's break down its components:\n\n**1. `prependClassStructure(targetFile, onlyStubs = false)`:** This is the main function. It asynchronously reads a JavaScript file (`targetFile`), analyzes its contents to extract class information, and then prepends a generated section containing class declarations to the beginning of the file.\n\n* **`readFile(targetFile)`:**  Reads the contents of the specified file (presumably using a helper function defined elsewhere, likely using Node.js's `fs` module).\n* **`getMethodsWithArguments(fileContent, onlyStubs)`:** (Detailed below)  Parses the JavaScript code to extract information about classes and their methods, including method names, arguments, and whether a method is a \"stub\" (empty or only containing a return statement).  The `onlyStubs` parameter controls whether only stub methods are considered.\n* **Class Structure Generation:**  The function iterates through the extracted class information, building a string (`listOfClasses`) that represents the class declarations. It can optionally include the method signatures (names and arguments).\n* **File Writing:**  Finally, it prepends the generated `listOfClasses` string to the original file content and writes the updated content back to the file using `writeFile`.\n\n**2. `getMethodsWithArguments(code, onlyStubs = false)`:** This function is the core of the code analysis.  It uses the `esprima-next` library to parse the JavaScript code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  It then traverses the AST to identify class declarations and their methods.\n\n* **AST Parsing:**  `esprima.parseModule` parses the code into an AST.\n* **Class and Method Extraction:** It iterates through the AST nodes, specifically looking for `ClassDeclaration` nodes (or exported class declarations). For each class, it extracts method names, arguments, and determines whether each method is a stub.\n* **Stub Method Filtering:** If `onlyStubs` is true, it filters the methods to only include stub methods.\n* **Sorting Classes:** It employs a depth-first search approach (`addClassAndSubclasses`) to ensure that parent classes are processed before their subclasses, maintaining a proper order of inheritance.\n* **Result Formatting:**  It organizes the extracted information into a structure where keys are class names, and values are arrays of method objects (containing method name, arguments, and whether it's a stub).\n\n\n**3. `getStubMethods(code)`:** This function simplifies the process of getting only stub methods. It calls `getMethodsWithArguments` with `onlyStubs = true` and then further filters the results to include only classes with at least one stub method.\n\n**4. `getListOfFunctions(code)`:** This function is similar to `getMethodsWithArguments`, but it focuses on extracting information about standalone functions (not methods within classes)  declared within the input code.\n\n\n**In summary:** The file provides a set of functions for automatically generating class skeletons based on existing JavaScript code.  This is useful for tasks like code scaffolding, refactoring, or generating documentation.  The use of `esprima-next` makes it robust in handling various JavaScript syntax variations. The inclusion of the `onlyStubs` option offers flexibility in choosing which methods to include in the generated code.  However, error handling (e.g., for invalid JavaScript code) is minimal or absent in the provided code.",
