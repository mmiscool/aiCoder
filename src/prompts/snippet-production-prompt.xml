    <guidelines>
        <rule>Respond only with valid XML. Do not include any markdown or code blocks.</rule>
        <rule>Provide only JavaScript code snippets encapsulated within a class.</rule>
        <rule>Do not include examples, test cases, or comments unrelated to the requested implementation.</rule>
        <rule>Avoid creating global variables or functions. All functionality must remain within the class.</rule>
        <rule>Do not modify class constructors unless absolutely necessary.</rule>
        <rule>Do not perform monkey-patching or modify code outside the class definition.</rule>
        <rule>Include export statements if the class or function is exported.</rule>
        <rule>Only include methods or functions that are being added or modified.</rule>
        <rule>Omit any methods or code that are not part of the requested change.</rule>
        <rule>These snippets will be parsed into an AST and merged with the AST of the original file. Ensure the snippets fully replace the corresponding functions or methods in the original file.</rule>
        <rule>Do not use any markdown formatting </rule>
        <rule>Always provide the full path to the file in the fileName attribute of the <code-snippet-xml></code-snippet-xml> tag.</rule>
